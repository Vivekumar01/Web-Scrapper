General Instructions
======================
1. Usage of any resources like google search, stackoverflow are ALLOWED
2. English Grammar is not important in code (as long as meaning is communicated properly)
3. Please add comments in code to help understand the code better
4. Assignments SHOULD be submitted before deadline



Assignment Submission Instructions
====================================
1. Code should be submitted as .py files and instructions to run the code should be specified clearly
2. Data provided for the assignments should NOT be shared with anyone strictly
3. You can work on any ONE or ALL of the assignment problems
4. Assignments will be evaluated on a first cum first serve basis
5. Any libraries used should be mentioned and instructions to install those libraries should be also mentioned
6. Performance (time taken by the code to run) will also be taken into consideration



Problem # 1 - Web scraper/Crawler
=================================
Write a web crawler (you can use any library such as BeautifulSoup, selenium etc.,) which does the following:
1. Read data from the amazon product web page (https://www.amazon.in/LG-24-inch-Monitor-Freesync-Borderless/dp/B08J5Y9ZSV/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&pf_rd_i=976392031&pf_rd_m=A1VBAL9TL5WCBF&pf_rd_p=fdf29120-98d8-40f7-810a-585fb8aa67c1&pf_rd_r=9NSA2WH49QR1TJ0815CK&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-4&pf_rd_t=101&qid=1634737622&smid=A14CZOWI0VEHLG&sr=8-2&th=1) 
2. Using code read access the ratings of the product 
3. Read all the top reviews of the product in the ratings page for this product
4. Read review text, review posted on date, review posted by person (name)
5. Write this data to an excel file with three columns (reviewer, posted_date, review_text)
6. Put both the python code files and output excel data file in a zip file and submit this zip file for the assignment


Problem # 2 - Data processing
=============================
You need to read data from a file and build a REST API (using any web framework such as Fastapi, Flask, Django etc.,). Details are as below:
1. Use the file provided (data.csv) file to read data from
2. Extract the column with name experienceMas, parse the number of years of experience (if experience is in months use 0 as number of years)
3. Categories the experience years into buckets 0-10, 11-20, 21-30, 31-40 so on
4. Count the number of people in each experience bucket.
5. Build a REST API which should provide the experience data as response in format like below (example response not actual values):
{
 "0-10": 29,
 "11-20": 41,
 "31-40": 5,
 "21-30": 12
}
6. Put code files and API response in a text file in zip file and upload as submission
7. Data might contain null values, invalid characters etc., which need to be handled/removed  appropriately
